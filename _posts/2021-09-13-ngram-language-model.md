# Ngram Language Model
Ngram Language Model is the classical language model firstly introduced and used in ASR. Also the most used language model open source tools-SRILM is developed to improve the ASR's output. Here the classical papers about ngram language model will be listed, the most frequently used open source tools of language model will be introduced.
